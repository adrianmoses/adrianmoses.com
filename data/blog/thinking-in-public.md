# Thinking in public

It’s only been a little over a year since I was diagnosed with ADHD.

It’s been helpful to know but it hasn’t made the struggles any easier. Maintaining consistent healthy habits have been tough. Impulse control and focus still wane well out our my control

I still have a long way to go with my emotional health and relationships.

But I know I need to keep trying. Consistency is key, but for me perseverance is what I need.

So I write this short essay with an attempt to start a habit, again. I hope to write short essays that help me think and process my life and mental health. Maybe someone who reads this will find it helpful too.

This will be my thinking, sharing in public.

And I hope to learn in public and build in public as well.

I like to learn not just machine learning and computer science. I like to learn about philosophy, sociology, fitness, health, finance, music, and much more. This will be an opportunity to share that.

I also enjoy building apps that solve problems in the areas I’m interested in.

So, let’s see where this goes. For now, I’ll start by taking it one day at a time.
