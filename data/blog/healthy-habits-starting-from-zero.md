Healthy Habits: Starting from Zero

I used to be in pretty good shape.

I’d work out every morning. Burning at least 1,000 calories a day. Well at least according to my Apple Watch. I’d also eat healthy whole meals and avoid alcohol and sweets.

Well not anymore.

I eat pretty much anything that’s junk now.

I wake up in the morning without much of a routine. Just a quick shower, groom and hop over to the nearest coffee shop. Then back home to sit in front of my computer for the rest of the day.

It hasn’t really bothered me that much.

There’s reasons for why it hasn’t caused me soul-crushing depression like it had during the pandemic.

I’m doing things I value. I feel a stronger connection with friends and family. And, with a little help of anti-anxiety pills, I have more compassion and trust for myself.

Still I want to improve my energy and health each day. That requires good habits. Besides, can’t be on this pills forever.

So I want to start with a small handful of habits. The main ones being the ones I enjoy and the ones I can easily get back into.

Here’s the habits I enjoy.

- playing piano
- writing
- learning machine learning
- building

What’s great is that I can combine these with my goals of learning in public and building in public.

Here’s habits that I need and can somewhat easily get back into.

- Sleep 7 hours at the same time each day
- Exercise
- Eating two healthy meals a day
- grooming routine
- morning journal
- window routine

These won’t be the easiest things in the world, but they are something I can obtain with some focus and elbow grease.
