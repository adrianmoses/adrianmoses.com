I want to start a writing series based on answering the question How To Start X? 

This question, for most subjects, isn’t without an answer. It isn’t even without a simple answer. 

However, for me, it’s been a difficult question to answer, nonetheless. Why? 

The reason why is simply because of emotions. See, what it is I want to start is usually boring, stressful, anxiety-inducing, and sometimes just plain painful.

With that said, I know deep down that what I want to do is valuable. It’s why I want to start it in the first place.

These paralyzing emotions take hold especially when there isn’t a habit formed to power through these emotions. When there isn’t a habit isn’t formed we have to consciously take actions despite our emotions. 

Which is why I’m here. I want to write HTS for me and hopefully anyone else who wants to do these activities. Writing down clear step by step instructions and preparing one’s environment to follow those instructions will take the guess work out of taking action.

I hope to keep these articles short and two the point. Releasing only once or twice a week. There’s only two sections

WAID (what am I doing) - this will be the actual actions to take to get started

MIE (Make it easy) - this will be about setting up your environment to make it very easy to get started on this.

That’s it. To commit to this, I’ll set up just 30 minutes a day and cycle through several steps. 

1. Idea and Research
2. More Research (if necessary)
3. Writing
4. Editing
5. Publish & Sharing

I’m new to writing and sharing online. So I may iterate and update my articles to improve clarity.
